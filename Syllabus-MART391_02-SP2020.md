## Description

In _ST: Hackathon_ students will explore the role of rapid ideation and prototyping with respect to creative process and innovation. In this 1-credit course, Students will attend the Montana Music, Media, & Art Hackathon (M3AH) at the University of Montana's Innovation Factory (IF) where they will work with a team to hack together a project based around the semesters hackathon theme. Students will work online (Moodle) prior to, and after the hackathon to discuss the role of rapid ideation in the arts and corporate worlds, learn about hackathons, and to create documentation and analysis of their completed hack projects.

## Objectives & Student Learning Outcomes (SLO's)

Through this course, students are expected to demonstrate an ability to:

- Discuss the role of Hackathons in arts-based and corporate innovation and ideation.
- Practice rapid prototyping, ideation, and innovation through a marathon style creative event known as a hackathon.
- Demonstrate iterative thinking as a process of generating ideas, producing prototypes in material, written or conceptual form, testing the prototypes, analyzing results, generating refinements and adjustments, and starting the process anew.
- Participate in collaborative teams where each student assesses their specific skill sets, contributes their skills successfully, gains experience in project management, and can reflect on and build from the skills of collaborative partners.
- Develop tiered problem-solving skills across a range of disciplines, and appreciate the consistent roles that critical thinking, empathy, flexibility, resourcefulness and iteration play in all successfully designed solutions.
- Nurture a process of empathetic reasoning while engaging differing perspectives, in such that, perspectives, cultures or content fields external to any individual’s own experience will be mined for growth and understanding.


## Pre-Requisites

There are no pre-requisites for this course.

## Books and Supplies

There are no _required_ books or supplies for this course. However, the individual projects that students choose to embark on as part of the M3AH may require additional materials, tools, digital content, hardware, or software, these will need to be purchased by the student.

_Students are encouraged to leverage IF, SVMA, and University resources where appropriate and when possible._

### Computer

If your project involves a computer, you will need to acquire access to one that can be used in the IF.

# Policies

## Course Evaluation

Student work and progress will be assessed through:

- Students abilities to work with a team.
- Students abilities to complete a project with their team over the course of a weekend hackathon.
- Students individual contributions to their team's project.
- Students ability to cogently present their hackathon project Saturday evening during the "Presentation of Hackathon Projects".
- The student's final documentation describing and representing the hack project  (a written technical report, written reflection, and demo video) as well the students individual contributions to this project.

#### Hackathon Project

Students are expected to work with a team to develop a unique project that directly or loosely relates to the theme of the semester hackathon. The goal of this hack project is always to make some sort of music/media/art-related work. Hacks take on the form of musical pieces, films, visual artworks, avant-journalism, theater works, analyses, apps, physical instruments, or something else based around creative technology, music, art, and/or media.

Using technology, at least at this hackathon, does not necessarily imply that participants need to use computers in their submissions. Participants are encouraged to use whatever tools, techniques, and technologies they deem fit to complete their project.

Students will work over 15 hours to identify, plan, develop, test, and iterate a project/artwork. Additionally, students should prepare a brief presentation for the Saturday evening Presentation of Hackathon Projects.

#### Post-Hack Documentation

Following the hackathon, students are expected to complete two written documents and a demo-video documenting their project. The written documents will include:

1. A technical description and discussion of the project, including analysis, reflection, and suggestions for future work.
2. An assessment of the student's team, as well as explicit identification of the students contributions to the team and a discussion of the teams dynamics for this project.

#### Participation

This class will be participatory, and you are expected to participate in the pre-hack class work (readings and forum discussion) as well as actively participate in person throughout the hackathon.



## Grades

#### Final Grades

Grades will be determined according to the following breakdown:

- Participation: 20%
- Hackathon Project: 50%
- Project Documentation: 30%

Letters are assigned according to the following final course percentages:

| Grade | % Range 	|
|:-----:|:---------:|
| A  	| `[93-100]`|
| A- 	| `[90-93)`	|
| B+ 	| `[87-90)`	|
| B  	| `[83-87)`	|
| B- 	| `[80-83)`	|
| C+ 	| `[77-80)`	|
| C  	| `[73-77)`	|
| C- 	| `[70-73)`	|
| D  	| `[60-70)`	|
| F  	| `[0-60)`	|


#### Late Work

IMPORTANT: Since projects are experienced as a group at the final Hackathon presentation, late projects are not permissible and will not be accepted.

Documentation assignments handed in after the due date and time will have points deducted for lateness. This will be in addition to any points deducted for content. Those that are uploaded late but within one day of the due date will lose 5% for lateness.  For those uploaded after that, the number of deducted points will be at the discretion of the professor.

## Attendance

Attendance at the pre-event online work and hackathon event are mandatory. Failure to attend will result in a failing grade.

## Plagiarism and Cheating Policy

Students are expected to adhere to academic conduct policies of the University of Montana as explained in Section V of your [University of Montana Student Conduct Code](http://www.umt.edu/student-affairs/dean-of-students/Student%20Conduct%20Code%20-%20FINAL%20-%208-24-18.pdf):  “Academic misconduct is subject to an academic penalty by the course instructor and/or a disciplinary sanction by the University.  Academic misconduct is defined as all forms of academic dishonesty, including but not limited to:  (1) plagiarism, (2) misconduct during an examination or academic exercise, (3) unauthorized possession of examination or other course materials, (4) tampering with course materials, (5) submitting false information, (6) submitting work previously presented in another course, (7) improperly influencing conduct, (8) substituting, or arranging substitution, for another student during an examination or other academic exercise, (9) facilitating academic dishonesty, and (10) Altering transcripts, grades, examinations, or other academically related documents.”

Dishonesty will not be tolerated in this course. This includes, but is not limited to, cheating on tests, cheating on assignments, fabricating information or citations, having unauthorized possession of examinations, submitting work of another person or work previously used, or tampering with the academic work of other students.

Plagiarism is the presentation of the work of another without acknowledgement. As defined by the [University of Montana’s Student Conduct Code](http://www.umt.edu/vpsa/policies/default.php), plagiarism is “Representing another person's words, ideas, data, or materials as one's own.”  Students may use information and ideas expressed by others, but this use must be identified by appropriate referencing.

Students who cheat or plagiarize will receive academic sanctions, which may include an “F” grade on the assignment, examination, and/or in the course. Students will also be reported to the Dean of Students for possible further disciplinary action.

#### Using Code or Media Found Elsewhere

It is easy to find code and media (i.e. videos, sounds, images, etc.) online. If you use code or media from elsewhere (which you will likely do for this hackathon), I expect you to cite the work and author.

If you use found code, you are expected to comment each line, as to what each line does programmatically. _Do not_ summarize several lines of code from a high level (i.e., TV Guide). I expect you to comment each line on a granular level. In addition, in these cases, I am also looking for significant modification of the code, for you to enact your own ideas and to experiment heavily. Significant modification means beyond variable name and value changes. It is bending these concepts to your idea, especially graphically. It is not a copy and paste job. Also, never more than 40% of your code may be supplied from elsewhere. Period. If you use code from online, whether for inspiration, modification or reference, I expect to see a link in your comments from where you got the code and who wrote it. Otherwise it will be considered as plagiarism, and you will fail the assignment. The code must have a reference, along with URL and be commented out LINE BY LINE.

If you use found media, *YOU* are responsible to ensure it is used according to fair-use guidelines. The pieces you make in this course are intended to be portfolio-quality works. Therefore, you should not utilize found media with restrictive use guidelines or licenses. You can read more about various licenses at;

- [opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/legal/)
- [choosealicense](https://choosealicense.com)
- [GNU Licenses](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.en.html)
- [Creative Commons Licenses](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/)
- [opensource.org](https://opensource.org/licenses)

For found media, you are also expected to cite the media in your documentation for the project.


## Students with Disabilities

The University of Montana assures equal access to instruction through collaboration between students with disabilities, instructors, and Disability Services for Students. Students with disabilities are encouraged to plan ahead and can contact [Disability Services for Students (DSS)](http://www.umt.edu/dss/). If you think you may have a disability adversely affecting your academic performance, and you have not already registered with Disability Services, please contact Disability Services in Lommasson Center 154, or call (406)243-2243. I will work with you and Disability Services to provide an appropriate modification.


## Changes to the Course

I reserve the right to change the intended content of this course throughout the semester. This may be done to adjust for the speed of the class, to better meet educational goals, or to account for changes in technology.

# Innovation Factory Specific Policies

## IF Overview

The [Innovation Factory (IF)](https://www.umt.edu/innovation-factory/) is a creative space that provides connections, opportunities, and resources for the campus and community alike.

The Innovation Factory (IF) is a gathering place of innovators, creatives, and entrepreneurs. It is a place to augment and expand a student’s experience from within any discipline. It is a touchpoint where the Missoula community can overlap with UM research and the innovative student engine. It can catalyze change.

IF is physically located on the 2nd floor of the UC, above the bookstore. It offers team-scaled collaborative workspace, the Worklab makerspace, and Blackstone LaunchPad, the entrepreneurial hub. Programing includes tours, workshops, demonstrations, internships, visiting designers and entrepreneurs, certificates and micro-credentials, and volunteer opportunities.

The space at the UC is one trailhead in an evolving physical and virtual network of innovation events, spaces and collaborative efforts. You can visit us and get inspired to design impactful change on your own, or build a team around an idea. You can utilize the connective Trailhead map on our wall to see other opportunities and innovation-based resources available to you on campus. You can take a one-credit module in a subset of innovative curricula to augment the powerful in-depth learning you do in your major. You can take a workshop and gain access (and responsibility) to the equipment in our Worklab, or walk-in and conduct self-guided design in our Tinkerspace.

## Advising Towards the Certificate

The culminating experiences of the Innovation Certificate challenges cohorts by underscoring team-building and connectivity. In Creative Collaboration each student works on a team with other students on projects that are student-generated, or from campus research, city or business partners, or community non-profits. As a final project, each student designs a comprehensive Digital Portfolio that exemplifies the Innovation Certificate and condenses the skills gained, partnerships built, and inherent navigation of a contemporary workforce.
