# COURSE OVERVIEW

## Basic Info

- CRN:
- Credits: 1
- Location: Innovation Factory in the UMT UC

## Description

In _Rapid Innovation through Hackathons_ students will explore the role of rapid ideation and prototyping with respect to creative process and innovation. In this 1-credit course, students will meet once before a hackathon and once after a hackathon to discuss the role of rapid ideation in the arts and corporate worlds. Students will also attend the Montana Music, Media, Art Hackathon (M3AH) at the University of Montana's Innovation Factory (IF) where they will work with a team to create a hack project based around the semesters hackathon theme.


## Objectives & Student Learning Outcomes

Through this course, students are expected to demonstrate an ability to:

- Discuss the role of Hackathons in arts-based and corporate innovation and ideation.
- Create a unique project in a diverse group that relates to the theme of the semesters M3AH.
- Practice rapid prototyping, ideation, and innovation through a marathon style creative event known as a hackathon.

## Pre-Requisites

There are no pre-requisites for this course.


## Books and Supplies

There are no required books or supplies for this course.

### Computer

You will need access to a computer capable of running modern audio synthesis and signal processing environments, as well as digital audio workstations (DAWs) and editing software. This computer should also be capable of real-time signal processing through analog inputs and outputs (i.e., using an audio interface or web cam).


# Policies

## Course Evaluation

Student work and progress will be assessed through:

- Students abilities to work with a team.
- Students abilities to complete a project with their team over the course of a weekend hackathon.
- Students individual contributions to their team's project.
- The final documentation describing and representing the hack project as well the students individual contributions to this project.

#### Project

Students are expected to work with a team to develop a project unique project that directly or loosely relates to the theme of the semester hackathon. The goal of this hack project is always to make some sort of music/media/art-related work. Hacks take on the form of musical pieces, films, visual artworks, avant journalism, theater works, analyses, apps, physical instruments, or something else else based around creative technology, music, art, and/or media.

Using technology, at least at this hackathon, does not necessarily imply that participants need to use computers in their submissions. Participants are encouraged to use whatever tools, techniques, and technologies they deem fit to complete their project.

#### Participation

This class will be participatory, and you are expected to participate in the pre-hack class meeting as well as throughout the hackathon.



## Grades

#### Final Grades

Grades will be determined according to the following breakdown:

- Participation: 30%
- Hackathon Project: 40%
- Project Documentation: 30%

Letters are assigned according to the following final course percentages:

| Grade | % Range 	|
|:-----:|:---------:|
| A  	| `[93-100]`|
| A- 	| `[90-93)`	|
| B+ 	| `[87-90)`	|
| B  	| `[83-87)`	|
| B- 	| `[80-83)`	|
| C+ 	| `[77-80)`	|
| C  	| `[73-77)`	|
| C- 	| `[70-73)`	|
| D  	| `[60-70)`	|
| F  	| `[0-60)`	|


#### Late Work

IMPORTANT: Since projects are experienced as a group at the final Hackathon presentation, late projects are not permissible and will not be accepted.

Documentation assignments handed in after the due date and time will have points deducted for lateness. This will be in addition to any points deducted for content. Those that are uploaded late but within one day of the due date will lose 5% for lateness.  For those uploaded after that, the number of deducted points will be at the discretion of the professor.

## Attendance

Attendance at the pre-event class and hackathon event is mandatory. Failure to attend will result in a failing grade.

## Plagiarism and Cheating Policy

Students are expected to adhere to academic conduct policies of the University of Montana as explained in Section V of your [University of Montana Student Conduct Code](http://www.umt.edu/student-affairs/dean-of-students/Student%20Conduct%20Code%20-%20FINAL%20-%208-24-18.pdf):  “Academic misconduct is subject to an academic penalty by the course instructor and/or a disciplinary sanction by the University.  Academic misconduct is defined as all forms of academic dishonesty, including but not limited to:  (1) plagiarism, (2) misconduct during an examination or academic exercise, (3) unauthorized possession of examination or other course materials, (4) tampering with course materials, (5) submitting false information, (6) submitting work previously presented in another course, (7) improperly influencing conduct, (8) substituting, or arranging substitution, for another student during an examination or other academic exercise, (9) facilitating academic dishonesty, and (10) Altering transcripts, grades, examinations, or other academically related documents.”

Dishonesty will not be tolerated in this course. This includes, but is not limited to, cheating on tests, cheating on assignments, fabricating information or citations, having unauthorized possession of examinations, submitting work of another person or work previously used, or tampering with the academic work of other students.

Plagiarism is the presentation of the work of another without acknowledgement. As defined by the [University of Montana’s Student Conduct Code](http://www.umt.edu/vpsa/policies/default.php), plagiarism is “Representing another person's words, ideas, data, or materials as one's own.”  Students may use information and ideas expressed by others, but this use must be identified by appropriate referencing.

Students who cheat or plagiarize will receive academic sanctions, which may include an “F” grade on the assignment, examination, and/or in the course. Students will also be reported to the Dean of Students for possible further disciplinary action.

#### Using Code or Media Found Elsewhere

It is easy to find code and media (i.e. videos, sounds, images, etc.) online. If you use code or media from elsewhere (which you will at times), I expect you to cite the work and author.

If you use found code, you are expected to comment each line, as to what each line does programmatically. _Do not_ summarize several lines of code from a high level (i.e., TV Guide). I expect you to comment each line on a granular level. In addition, in these cases, I am also looking for significant modification of the code, for you to enact your own ideas and to experiment heavily. Significant modification means beyond variable name and value changes. It is bending these concepts to your idea, especially graphically. It is not a copy and paste job. Also, never more than 40% of your code may be supplied from elsewhere. Period. If you use code from online, whether for inspiration, modification or reference, I expect to see a link in your comments from where you got the code and who wrote it. Otherwise it will be considered as plagiarism, and you will fail the assignment. The code must have a reference, along with URL and be commented out LINE BY LINE.

If you use found media, *YOU* are responsible to ensure it is used according to fair-use guidelines. The pieces you make in this course are intended to be portfolio-quality works. Therefore, you should not utilize found media with restrictive use guidelines or licenses. You can read more about various licenses at;

- [opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/legal/)
- [choosealicense](https://choosealicense.com)

- [Creative Commons Licenses](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/)
- [opensource.org](https://opensource.org/licenses)

For found media, you are also expected to cite the media in your documentation for the project.



## Students with Disabilities

The University of Montana assures equal access to instruction through collaboration between students with disabilities, instructors, and Disability Services for Students. Students with disabilities are encouraged to plan ahead and can contact [Disability Services for Students (DSS)](http://www.umt.edu/dss/). If you think you may have a disability adversely affecting your academic performance, and you have not already registered with Disability Services, please contact Disability Services in Lommasson Center 154, or call (406)243-2243. I will work with you and Disability Services to provide an appropriate modification.




## Changes to the Course

I reserve the right to change the intended content of this course throughout the semester. This may be done to adjust for the speed of the class, to better meet educational goals, or to account for changes in technology.
