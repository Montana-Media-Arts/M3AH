The “Montana Music, Media, Art Hackathon” (M3AH) brings together musicians, artists, journalists, actors, directors, programmers, scientists, engineers, hardware tinkerers, and open-minded thinkers to spend an intensive weekend together where they will hack together projects exploring art, music, and media. At 4pm on Sunday we have a show and presentations of the art, technology, and research developed that day. It’s open to everyone. Please come participate or observe.
Organized by the College of the Arts and Media (CAM) and the Innovation Factory (IF) at the University of Montana, this event kicks off Friday evening with inspirational and informational talks centered around the M3AH theme/topic for the weekend. This is followed by an organizational meeting to help those without groups or ideas find both. Groups or teams are then encouraged to work from Friday evening until Sunday evening when they present the results of their weekend hack project. 


# 1. Information About Hackathons
The word “hackathon” is a  portmanteau  of the words “[hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_)“ and “[marathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon) “, where “hack” is used in the sense of exploratory programming. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon)). 
The purpose of Hackathons is rapid prototyping, building new projects, and presenting them at the end of the event. There are different types and topics of hackathons all over the world but the goal is the same – prototype something that is an artistic expression and/or improves and contributes to our lives. Hackathons provide a venue for self-expression and creativity through technology. People with varied backgrounds come together, form teams around a problem or idea, and collaboratively code/develop/build a unique solution from scratch ([Hackathons Anonymous](https://medium.com/hackathons-anonymous/wtf-is-a-hackathon-92668579601)). A hackathon is a place that combines technology, business, art, and culture.

M3AH differs from a traditional hackathon in a few ways. For one, the goal of our Hackathons is always to make some sort of music/media/art-related hack. Hacks take on the form of musical pieces, films, visual artworks, avant journalism, theater works, analyses, apps, physical instruments, and whatever else you dream up that is based around creative technology, music, art, or media. 
Using technology, at least at this hackathon, does not necessarily imply that participants need to use computers in their submissions. Participants are encouraged to use whatever tools, techniques, and technologies they deem fit to complete their project. 

# 2. Innovation Factory 
With the M3AH being based in the Innovation Factory participants will have access to the tools, equipment, technologies, and expertise that this space offers the larger Missoula community. In addition to providing a work space for teams, participants are encouraged and welcome to use the resources that this center has to offer in order to further or complete their projects. 


# 3. Who Is Invited
All respectful and kind artists, musicians, film makers, journalists, engineers, scientists and tinkerers from invited to participate in this event. More specifically, we invite the University community (students, staff, and faculty) as well as the larger community of Missoula and Western Montana. This is an inclusive event. 

# 4. 1 Credit Courses
For students needing UMT credits, there are two courses that each offer 1 credit. 
1. **“Rapid Innovation through Hackathons” - MART 361** - This course allows students to receive 1 credit for participating in and completing the M3AH. In addition to participating in the actual hackathon students taking this course are expected to attend one 2 hour session the week prior to the hackathon about rapid prototyping and hackathon preparation. Students are also expected to submit documentation of their project (in the form of; a demo video; technical and artistic description paper; and relevant media, code, scores, schematics, etc), as well as a short write-up about their personal contributions to the project, their experiences of the hackathon, and any lessons learned through this work. 
2. **”Organizing and Facilitating Innovation through Hackathons - MART 362** - This course allows students to receives 1 credit for help organizing, promoting, and facilitating the M3AH. In addition to assisting in facilitation during the event, students taking this course will meet twice prior to the hackathon and twice following the hackathon. Prior to the hackathon students will assist in developing the theme further, organizing speakers, promoting the event, and arranging equipment. During the event students will assist participants and will gain knowledge about how to facilitate rapid creative ideation. Following the event students will assist in the collection and editing of documentation about the event, as well as discuss ways of making future events stronger. Students taking this class will not participate in the hackathon as a hacker, instead that will learn what it takes in corporate, research, artistic, or academic environments to facilitate the type of rapid ideation by others that leads to social change and technological innovation. 


# 5. Sample Schedule
- Friday (5pm - 10pm)

	- 7:30pm - Team and Idea Organization - All hackers will break into teams. For those who need to find teams this time will be used to identify other teams who need additional members or groups of participants who might team up together. Teams should be formed that include participants interested in working towards a similar project idea with a diverse array of skills. 
	- 8pm - Team Ideation and Organization - Following the creation of teams, individual teams should settle on a project idea, create an initial work plan, assign tasks, and determine what gear (if any) needs to be brought from home or other places for tomorrow.
